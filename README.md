- Web Scraping is the process of information extraction from resources that are located on the World Wide Web and the classification of scraped and unstructured data (usually found in HTML pages) in a structured form like Spreadsheets or database tables.

## Overview

The main purpose of these projects is to find information related to basketball players names and their pictures.  Also, gathering a favorite movie poster from a movie rating website and checking for the top rated Indian movies according to www.imdb.com. Note:  This can be apply to other projects.


As a General rule follow this three steps below.

> **First step:**

      The first thing to do is to inspect the element page.  You can do this manually in order to locate tags that you might be interested in. 

> **Second step:**

      After, you decide what tags or classes to grab then download the HTML documents by using Selenium and PhantomJS.
