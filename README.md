## Using Python along with Selenium, PhantomJS and Beautiful Soup 

### 

As a General rule I will follow this three steps below.

*Firts step:*

The first thing to do is to inspect the element page.  You can do this manually in order to locate tags that you might be interested in. 

*Second step:*

After, you decide what tags or classes to grab then download the HTML documents by using Selenium and PhantomJS.


*Third step:*

You can use Beautiful soup objects by searching by tags codes and finally extract the data found on those respective tags.
