# Web-Scraping

## Using Python along with Selenium, PhantomJS and Beautiful Soup 


## Overview

The main purpose of this project is to do webscraping on websites in order to get vital information from it. 
For instance, gathering basketball players names and their pictures.  Also, gathering your favorite movie poster from a movie rating website and checking for the top rated Indian movies according to www.imdb.com. 


As a General rule follow this three steps below.

> **First step:**

      The first thing to do is to inspect the element page.  You can do this manually in order to locate tags that you might be interested in. 

> **Second step:**

      After, you decide what tags or classes to grab then download the HTML documents by using Selenium and PhantomJS.


> **Third step:**

     You can use Beautiful soup objects by searching by tags codes and finally extract the data found on those respective tags.
