# Web Scraping

## Using Python along with Selenium, PhantomJS and Beautiful Soup 

- Web scraping is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. 
- Web Scraping is the process of information extraction from resources that are located on the World Wide Web and the classification of scraped and unstructured data (usually found in HTML pages) in a structured form like Spreadsheets or database tables.

## Overview

As a General rule follow this three steps below.

> **First step:**

      The first thing to do is to inspect the element page.  You can do this manually in order to locate tags that you might be interested in. 

> **Second step:**

      After, you decide what tags or classes to grab then download the HTML documents by using Selenium and PhantomJS.


> **Third step:**

     You can use Beautiful soup objects by searching by tags codes and finally extract the data found on those respective tags.
